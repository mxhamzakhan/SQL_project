# Introduction

This project started with a mission: crack the code on the most lucrative data analyst skills. Inspired by Luke Barousse's insightful [SQL Course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). I embarked on a data exploration to identify the top-paying skills for Data Analysts (both remote and in India)

Check out the SQL queries here: [project_sql folder](/project_sql/)

# Tools Used ‚õèÔ∏èüßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª

To navigate the data analyst job market, I enlisted a powerful toolkit:

- **SQL:** It served as the foundation, enabling me to interrogate the database and extract valuable insights.
- **PostgreSQL:** My database management system of choice, offered a robust platform for managing the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code:** Provided a familiar environment for database interaction and executing SQL queries.
- **Git and GitHub:** ensured seamless version control and collaboration by allowing me to track changes and share my SQL scripts and analysis.


# Analysis
### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs:
I filtered top 10 paying data analyst jobs based on their average yearly salary while focusing on remote jobs and then I ran the same query again focusing on data analyst jobs in India.
#### a. Remote:
```sql
SELECT
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date:: DATE
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id=job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location='Anywhere' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10;
```

#### b. India:
```sql
SELECT 
    job_title,
    name AS company_name,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_schedule_type,
    job_posted_date:: DATE
FROM 
    job_postings_fact
LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id=job_postings_fact.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_location='India' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

LIMIT 10;
```

        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON company_dim.company_id=job_postings_fact.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short ='Data Analyst' AND
        job_location='Anywhere' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

    ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC

    LIMIT 10
    )

SELECT 
    top_jobs.*,
    skills
